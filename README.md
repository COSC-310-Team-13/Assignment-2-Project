# Team 13 Project Overview
## Project Description

We are developing a conversational agent for a call center that responds to customer complaints. The agent will be able to cross reference from a catalog and log basic complaints.

The SDLC we have chosen is agile as we believe that for a small project such as this that requires frequent customer testing, it will be beneficial to have many versions of the chatbot, incrementally increasing functionality with each iteration. The focus is to have a working product and we do not require extensive documentaion.
